# instruction-set-based-ecc
In this paper, we present a novel instruction-set based high-speed hardware implementation 1 for elliptic curve cryptography for Koblitz curve secp256r1 on FPGA. Through modifications of Koggle 2 Stone adders into the structure of modular multiplication and inversion units, we achieve high-speed 3 result with the modular computation architecture.
